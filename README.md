# Data Modeling in Power BI

I found a retail dataset from a global superstore spanning four years on Kaggle, and I decided to explore it. Using this dataset, I constructed the following Star Schema, which comprises both fact and dimension tables with relationships linking them together. 

The initial video provides a brief overview of the process I took to create this Star Schema. To keep the first video concise, I only created the first dimension table. However, the second video is a quick about two-minute, sped-up video of the remaining dimension tables.
